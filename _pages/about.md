I am a Postdoc Researcher in [School of Journalism and Communication](https://www.tsjc.tsinghua.edu.cn/xysz/jszy/xnjzjs.htm) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My research interests lie in Health Communication, Science Communication, Open Science, New Media, and Media Psychology. Specifically, I have utilized utilizing quantitative research methods to examine the outcomes of stigma in health issues, societal and science misinformation, and social media feedback in science outreach. 
I am also working at [Open Science Team of Tsinghua University Library](https://opensign.lib.tsinghua.edu.cn/) to examine and monitor open science practices.
